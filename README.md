# Beta Supplies
## This project is designed to highlight what I have learnt so far from HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It also combines my love of climbing and shopping for climbing supplies. 

## UX
This website is designed to be used by climbers, to be efficient in the finding of equipment and the latest information. 

User stories:

As a climber, I want to find the latest deals on climbing supplies, so that I can afford better equipment.
It's for this reason that I ensured that the latest sale items were in a jumbotron at the top of the site,

As a climber I want to be able to see the latest information. 
It's for this reason that the latest blogs are a section on the home page, each with links that would go to induvidual blog posts. 

## Wireframes: 
https://github.com/OllieMedley/ms1.2/tree/master/wireframe

I removed the search bar from the header and the radio buttons from the product pages as I felt they would be there just to be there, and it isn't something I wanted. Once I am able to add funcitoning versions it may be somehting I look at adding in. 

The typography that I chose was designed to be more rustic and reminisent of rock face, which is why I chose Bangers, I chose Encode as a juxtaposition to this to display factually correct information. 

## UX

Strategy: 
I wanted to provide a place to source climbing equipment and to give people access to the latest information about climbing.

## Deployment
All code was written on Gitpod, an online IDE.
The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my Repository.
Under the settings section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.
Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.
There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.
The code can be run locally through clone or download.
You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button, and selecting either 'clone or download'.
The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.
The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file that can be unzipped on your local machine.
